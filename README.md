Now that we have osTicket set up, we can configure many different items within. The first being roles. When logged in, we switch to the admin panel. We select agents, and then roles. We click add new role and then from there we can add whatever role we please with whatever permissons are necessary for the role.

<p>
Within the same area (admin panel -> agents) we can configure the different departments within the system. We can then group various users by department.

There is also an option for configuring teams. These can be used to group various people from different departments into a team in order to tackle certain challenges that my come up. There is also an option to assign a team leader if necessary.

<p>
Within the admin panel, you can add different agents to work the ticketing system. Within the setup, you can assign them to departments and teams. From the agent panel, you can add new users. These are the people who will be submitting tickets to the ticketing system when they need help.

<p>
You are also able to configure the various service level agreements(SLA's) within the system. These will define the various levels of severity that each ticket posesses. This will determine which tickets need to be serviced first and in what order they need to get done. In addition, they will define the working hours of the ticket. These can range from normal work hours to 24/7 service being required. 
</p>

<p>
These are the various options you have when configuring the OSTicket system. You are also able to configure the topics that users are able to use when requesting service. These will be created for the osTicket lifecycle demonstration!
